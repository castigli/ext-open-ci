# Extenal open projects CI
This repository is intended to provide CI coverage for hardware specific tests of open source projects.

The rationale is that we cannot provide runners for these projects for several reasons (governance, resource commitments, etc...), but we can provide coverage for hardware deployed at CSCS.
